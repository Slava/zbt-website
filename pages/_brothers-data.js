I'm a part of a Christian community in campus called Cru, and it's friggen awesome.

I rode into the first sunset in sight. I was born with a fully developed Jewish grandmother voice and doctors say that my birth was directly related to the eventual discovery of the Higgs [Boson, a particle with important implications to our understanding of the universe]. I guess that makes more sense than the fact that I had 3 parents and that one of them would eventually become my big at ZBT. Anyway, when I was halfway to the horizon, I was met by the most majestic creature I had ever laid eyes upon. Imagine an unimaginable bald eagle with features only matched by those of Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. In its claws it carried the prestigious ‘Tube’ that contained both my completed application and acceptance letter to MIT. That moment is when I found out the meaning of the solar flare I had witnessed earlier. I had to longboard to Cambridge, Massachusetts. I am actually only a couple months old (in my frame of reference), but on my journey I managed to reach relativistic speeds that resulted in me circling the Earth thousands of times.
